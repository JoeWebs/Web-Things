            <p id="aboutp">Hello, wonderous internet searcher.
            <br>
            <br>
            My name is Joseph Kelly and as you can tell this is my website.
            I am 17 years old at the time of making this site and I make websites for fun and hopefully for profit.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am a good developer in my mind but I am in no way a good designer. I have no design sense in my body and it shows with websites.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h2 id="what">What Do I Do?</h2>
            <p id="whatp">I make websites as I stated in the 'About' section.
            <br>
            <br>
            What I do is I make websites. Right now I am doing them for free just to build up a portfolio. Maybe one day I will make it into a profitable thing but, for now I am not.</p>

    			<br>
    			<br>
    			Please note this does look somewhat designed good but in reality this is just the frameworks base design features. I can make something similar to this but I am not a website designer I am a developer.</p>

    				<li>Why is this one page?</li>

    				<h2 id="tips">Tips for media on a site</h2>
    					<p id="tipsp">My best tip for media be it video, pictures ect. Is to put them on a site that holds media. For videos use youtube as a video storage area. Then I can embed the video into the site without using disk space. For pictures I recommend photobucket. I can get the url for the photo and link it directly into the site.
    					<br>
    					Just for the videos upload them to youtube and set the video as private then give me the embed link and we are set. For the pictures upload them to photobucket and give methe name and I will pull the url from it and put it onto the site</p>

                    <p id="upc">
                        One thing in the works is I am trying to set up one of my computers to handle web hosting so I can offer free web hosting to people I make sites for. This is still in the works but I will hopefully complete it soon.
